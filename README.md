# Introduction

My name is Mitchell Mecham and I am an aspiring Computer Scientist studying at Brigham Young University Idaho. Some of my hobbies include learning foreign languages, playing video games, and going on long walks.

This repository was made to show off what I believe to be my most important learning experiences, as well as what I consider to be my biggest successes' on my learning journey. I want to share this with all of you so that you can get to know me a little better, or have a chance to learn something yourself.

Feel free to use any code found in any of my projects.
